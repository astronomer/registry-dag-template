### This will be the DAG display title on the Astronomer Registry. Don't use more than ~8 words on the title.

The first sentence here will be the DAG description. Be descriptive, but concise. 

Add as much detail as you want here. Talk through what the DAG is doing, the different providers used, and any additional setup instructions.
This DAG is intended to be a demonstration of a number of core Airflow concepts related to pipeline authoring
including TaskFlow API, branching, Edge Labels, Jinja templating, dynamic task generation, Task Groups, and
Trigger Rules.
